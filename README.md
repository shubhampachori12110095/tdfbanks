# Time-Domain Filterbanks

PyTorch implementation of [Learning Filterbanks from Raw Speech for Phone Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01161) (ICASSP 2018).

Time-Domain Filterbanks (TD-filterbanks) are neural network layers intended to operate on a raw audio waveform. At initialization, they approximate standard mel-filterbanks by computing [first-order scattering coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6763). They can then be fine-tuned with the architecture. Options of mel-filterbanks can be specified, such as a pre-emphasis layer, a log compression of the coefficients, or their mean-variance normalization.

## Different types of TD-Filterbanks
There are four different modes for TD-filterbanks:
* **Fixed**: Initialize the layers to match mel-filterbanks and keep their parameters fixed when training the model
* **Learn-all**: Initialize the layers and let the filterbank and the averaging be learned jointly with the model
* **Learn-filterbank**: Start from the initialization and only learn the filterbank with the model, keeping the averaging fixed to a squared hanning window
* **Randinit**: Initialize the layers randomly and learn them with the network

## TD-filterbanks

Time-Domain Filterbanks are a neural architecture composed of a complex-valued convolution, a modulus operator and a grouped real-valued convolution. This structure is based on the computation of first-order scattering coefficients. They are generated by a call to the class TDFbanks:

```python
import melfilters
import utils
import model
# Main parameters
layer_params = dict(
                    mode = 'fixed',          # type of td-fbanks (fixed, learnall, learnfbanks)
                    nfilters = 40,           # number of filters
                    samplerate = 16000,      # samplerate of the waveform
                    wlen = 25,               # length of the window (in milliseconds)
                    wstride = 10,            # stride of the window
                    compression = 'log',     # compression of coefficients (log or None)
                    preemp = True,           # add a pre-emphasis layer below the td-fbanks
                    mvn = True)              # perform mean-variance normalization per utterance on the coefficients

tdfbanks = model.TDFbanks(**layer_params)
```

## Initialization

When Time-Domain Filterbanks are generated, the weights of the convolutional layers are initialized randomly. With mode="learnall" and without initialization, this corresponds to the **randinit** type of TD-filterbanks. One can initialize them to match standard mel-filterbanks:

```python
#Initialization parameters
init_params = dict(
                    min_freq = 0,             # minimum frequency spanned by the filters
                    max_freq = 8000,          # maximum frequency spanned by the filters
                    nfft = 512,               # number of frequency bins for the mel-filterbanks to replicate
                    window_type = 'hamming',  # windowing function
                    normalize_energy = False, # replicate mel-filterbanks normalized or energy or that peak at 1
                    alpha = 0.97)             # pre-emphasis parameter

tdfbanks.initialize(**init_params)
```
